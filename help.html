		<h3> Question: Why are there different groups? How should I distinguish my groups? </h3>
		<p class = "answer"> 
			Different groups should have different sites that are at different 
			times. For example, if I wanted to block Twitter only in the 
			morning and YouTube only at night, I would use two different 
			groups. If I wanted to block Twitter and YouTube in the morning and 
			at night, I would use one group. If I wanted to block YouTube in 
			the morning and at night, but Twitter only in the morning, I would 
			use two groups. 
		</p>

		<br>
		<h3> Question: What does the "block all sites" button do? </h3>
		<p class = "answer"> 
			This button compiles all the websites from every group that you 
			have active (selected green for on) and blocks those websites 
			until midnight. 
		</p>

		<br>
		<h3> Question: I made a change on settings, reloaded, and the change didn't register? </h3>
		<p class = "answer"> 
			Changes are saved automatically: 500ms after the last edit and when 
			you close the page. There is also a 'save' button in the top left
			corner which can manually save the page, when clicked. All of the 
			settings are collected and given to Chrome to be written to the 
			storage. This can sometimes be slow, depending on what else Chrome 
			is doing. Whenever you reload the settings page, it gets whatever 
			data is already in Chrome's storage, which can be not up to date. 
			If you edit and save a non-up-to-date settings page, it will 
			overwrite anything you saved previously. 
		</p>

		<br>
		<h3> Question: Can I change / add to the photos that show on the blocked site? </h3>
		<p class = "answer"> 
			YES! First, move your image into the folder titled "images" within 
			the "blockSites" extension folder. Then, put the name of those 
			images and some alt text in the file "blocked.js". There are more 
			instructions of where exactly to write those within that file. 
		</p>

		<br>
		<h3> Question: What does the "I changed time zones / recheck" button do? </h3>
		<p class = "answer"> 
			This button is located on the popup, which can be accessed by
			clicking on the extension icon in the top right.
			The way that the code works to see what websites should be blocked is 
			by using the current time and calculating when it will need to next check
		 	(when another site should start being blocked or the current ones should
		  	become unblocked). This calculation for re-checking is in minutes. 
			Therefore, if you change time zones before the next check should happen,
			it will be off. The button manually makes it recalculate what sites 
			should be currently blocked. 
		</p>

		<br>
		<h3> Question: what do the pause buttons do? </h3>
		<p class = "answer"> 
			This button is located on the popup, which can be accessed by
			clicking on the extension icon in the top right. 
			The "pause until midnight" button stops all sites from being 
			blocked until midnight, when the normal blocking schedules resume.
			The "pause for __ minutes" button stops all sites from being blocked
			for the amount of time given. The minimum time is 1 minute, the
			maximum is 1440 minutes (24 hours). 
			The pausing can be undone by clicking the "re-check button"......

	 	<h3> Question: Why do you have all those permissions? Are you reading and changing information on all sites? </h3>
	 	<p class = "answer"> 
	 		Chrome has designated the URL to be a sensitive property of a tab. 
	 		Therefore, this extension uses a strong permission, "tabs". Using 
	 		"tabs" creates a warning that says this extension can "read your 
	 		browsing history". This permission cannot actually read any past 
	 		browsing you have done, it can only read the URL information of 
	 		current sites. The other permissions are "storage" and "alarms" 
	 		whose usages are explained in a later question. 
	 	</p>

		<br>
	 	<h3> Question: I put the same website in sites to block and sites to exclude from blocking, what will happen? </h3>
	 	<p class = "answer"> 
	 		The website will not block. If, in the same time period, you have 
	 		"youtube.com" in the block list but also you have "youtube.com" in 
	 		the exclude list, it will not block. The sites being in the same time 
	 		period is the only thing that matters, not what groups they 
	 		originated from. 
	 	</p>

	 	<br>
	 	<h3> Question: More specifically, what is being stored? What alarms will fire? </h3>
	 	<p class = "answer"> 
	 		There are two things being stored: "config" and "currentBlock". 
	 		"config" is the user's settings: a list of groups, where each group 
	 		has the name, active status, sites to block, sites to exclude, 
	 		times, and days. "currentBlock" stores a list of currently blocked 
	 		websites and a list of currently excluded websites. "currentBlock" 
	 		is checked against any sites that update. Alarms fire when a new 
	 		time starts or the current time block ends, then, "config" is 
	 		re-analyzed to chose the new websites that should be in 
	 		"currentBlock". 
	 	</p>
