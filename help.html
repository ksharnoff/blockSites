		<h3> Question: Do I have to press save? (on the settings page)</h3>
		<p > Once you press save then all the text you wrote in the inputs and all the buttons that you pressed will be saved to your chrome local storage. It only saves with the save button so I don't have to keep writing stuff to storage constantly. (more efficient and easier) </p>


		<br>
		<h3> Question: Why are there different groups? How should I distinguish my groups?</h3>
		<p> Different groups should have different sites that are at different times. For example, if I wanted to block twitter in the morning and youtube at night, I would use two different groups. If I wanted to block twitter and youtube in the morning and at night, I would use one group. If I wanted to block youtube in the morning and at night, but twitter only in the morning, I would use two groups. </p>

		<h3> Question: What does the "block all sites" button do? </h3>
		<p> This button accesses all the websites from every group that you have active (selected green for on) and blocks those websites from midnight until midnight. </p>

		<br>
		<h3> Question: Can I change / add to the photos that show on the blocked site? </h3>
		<p> YES! First, move your image into the folder titled "images" within the "blockSites" extension folder. Then, put the name of those images and some alt text in the file "blocked.js". There are more instructions of where exactly to write those within that file. </p>

		<br>
		<h3> Question: Can I have more than 8 groups? </h3>
		<p> Yes -- ask Kezia and they will send you a file with as many groups as you like. I coded it poorly so I have to copy / paste each save button. </p>
